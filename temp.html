    Lord of the Flies Presentation Outline
MY ASSIGNED CHARACTER, THEME AND SYMBOL
Simon, “Fear of the Unknown”, The Beast


THESIS STATEMENT
WHAT?
The topic of "Fear of the Unknown," the character of Simon, and the symbol of the beast all fit together to examine the devastating force of terror, the conflict between civilization and barbarism, and the underlying darkness inside people in Lord of the Flies. They illustrate the psychological and moral ramifications of yielding to fear, as well as the consequences for people and society.
How do these elements fit together? What do they mean collectively?
SO WHAT?
In my presentation, I will stress the significance of understanding Lord of the Flies' theme, character, and symbol. By investigating the subject of "Fear of the Unknown," we get insight into the common human experience of struggling with the unknown and its influence on our actions. We see the potential for empathy, knowledge, and the struggle against the evil inside ourselves by focusing on the character of Simon. The beast's emblem reflects primitive tendencies and the disintegration of civilisation, acting as a warning of the perils of fear and ignorance.
Make this topic specific for your presentation. Why is your “what” important?
THESIS STATEMENT
In LOTF, the interaction between the concept of "Fear of the Unknown," Simon, and the symbol of the beast serves as a profound investigation of the devastating force of dread, the conflict between civilization and barbarism, and the underlying evil inside people. This work illustrates the significant psychological and moral ramifications of surrendering to fear by addressing the boys' spiral into chaos and violence motivated by their dread of the unknown, Simon's function as a figure of wisdom and compassion amongst the darkness, and the growing symbolism of the beast. Understanding the interconnection of these factors forces us to explore our own capacity for good and evil, the fragility of social structures, and the judgments we make when faced with fear and uncertainty. LOFT is a cautionary tale that leads us to confront some of our unknown fears, maintain our humanity, and say no to the rise of barbarism in our own lives and civilizations.
Combine your “What?” and your “So what?” to formulate a working thesis statement


ARGUMENT 1
TOPIC OF ARGUMENT 1
The escalating fear of the unknown leads to the breakdown of civilization on the island.
How does this argument prove my thesis statement?
This argument demonstrates how the increasing dread of the unknown leads to the disintegration of civilisation and the decline into barbarism. It promotes the notion that fear has destructive power and emphasizes the psychological and moral consequences of surrendering to fear. The novel's proofs show how the characters' fear-driven behaviors correlate with the themes of terror, civilization vs barbarism, and the underlying evil inside humanity, strengthening the thesis statement's core claims.
PROOF 1 FROM NOVEL
Quotation: "The thing is - fear can't hurt you any more than a dream. There aren't any beasts to be afraid of on this island." (Chapter 6)
Quotation + reference
How does this proof support my argument?
This quote from Simon emphasizes the boys' discovery that the beast is a reflection of their own anxieties and inner darkness, rather than an external threat. It bolsters the case by demonstrating how their growing dread of the unknown contributes to the deterioration of civilized conduct and their decline into barbarism.
PROOF 2 FROM NOVEL
"The desire to squeeze and hurt was over-mastering" (Chapter 9).
Quotation + reference
How does this proof support my argument?
This account of the boys' actions during Simon's murder exemplifies the boys’ increasing fear-driven cruelty. The idea is backed by demonstrating how the beast's dread of the unknown sparks their aggressive urges and leads to the collapse of moral control and empathy.


ARGUMENT 2
TOPIC OF ARGUMENT 2
Simon's function as a symbol of wisdom and compassion in the midst of darkness underscores the significance of remaining human in the face of adversity.

This argument supports the thesis statement by emphasizing Simon's function as a figure of wisdom and compassion in the midst of adversity. It reinforces the notion that preserving humanity in the face of fear is critical. The novel highlights Simon's unselfish deeds and his profound awareness of the evil inside human nature, supporting the idea that he stands in contrast to the other boys' fear-driven brutality. The argument strengthens the thesis statement that retaining humanity and opposing the decline into barbarism is a key topic in the novel by stressing Simon's function as an embodiment of light and conscience.
PROOF 1 FROM NOVEL
"Simon found for them the fruit they could not reach, pulled off the choicest from up in the foliage, passed them back down to the endless outstretched hands" (Chapter 3).

"You knew, didn't you? I'm part of you." (Chapter 8)



Quotation + reference
How does this proof support my argument?
This line from "Lord of the Flies" during Simon's encounter shows Simon's understanding that the beast is simply a manifestation in the minds of the boys, almost as if they had to fight something to be able to get off the island. It also supports the argument by emphasizing Simon's wisdom and logical thinking while understanding he is trapped on an island, which would be hard for anyone to do, making it all the more significant that he is a child.


ARGUMENT 3
TOPIC OF ARGUMENT 3
The symbol of the beast is a manifestation of the boys' fears, but their fear of the unknown leads them to delude themselves into believing in its existence.



How does this argument prove my thesis statement?
By emphasizing how the children's dread of the unknown causes them to deceive themselves into thinking the beast exists, this argument supports the thesis statement. It bolsters the notion that fear has the capacity to skew reality and mold perceptions. The examples from the book show how the boys' vision was skewed and how they tended to put their fears into the beast's emblem. The argument furthers the claim that people may fool themselves and believe in illusions that are the result of their own worries by demonstrating their misconception.
PROOF 1 FROM NOVEL
"He says the beast comes out of the sea" (Chapter 5).
Quotation + reference
How does this proof support my argument?
This passage exemplifies how the boys' perspective of the beast is distorted by their fear and imagination. They start to attribute supernatural attributes to it and think it is a product of the sea. It bolsters the case by illuminating their misperception and the role that fear had in forming their ideas. It demonstrates how some of them lose contact with reality almost immediately after the story begins, which might simply be a stress reaction following a change from their usual lifestyle to this one.
PROOF 2 FROM NOVEL
"Maybe there is a beast... maybe it's only us" (Chapter 5).
Quotation + reference
How does this proof support my argument?
The beast is within them, Simon realizes, underscoring their delusion. He understands that the beast is a reflection of their inner fears and darkness rather than an outside threat. This evidence demonstrates how the boys' skewed perception and inclination to deceive themselves as a result of their dread what is ahead support the claim.





CONCLUSION
How do these three elements go together to prove your thesis statement?
The three arguments work together to provide a comprehensive proof of the thesis statement by building onto eachother.

Argument 1 highlights the destructive power of fear of the unknown and its role in the breakdown of civilization. It establishes fear as a central theme in the novel and supports the thesis statement by demonstrating how fear leads to the descent into savagery.

Argument 2 focuses on Simon's character as a symbol of wisdom and compassion amidst the darkness. It reinforces the importance of maintaining humanity in the face of fear, supporting the thesis statement's emphasis on the struggle between good and evil.

Argument 3 explores the distortion of reality caused by the fear of the unknown and the boys' delusion regarding the existence of the beast. It reinforces the thesis statement by showcasing how fear can lead individuals to deceive themselves and believe in illusions born from their own fears.

Together, these arguments offer a thorough analysis of the book, covering various dimensions of subject, character, and symbol. Together, they provide evidence for the thesis statement by highlighting the negative effects of fear, the value of preserving humanity, and the deception that fear may cause. The whole argument is strengthened and the novel's main point is reinforced by this all-encompassing strategy.

















Brainstorm:


For our Lord of the Flies presentation, I'd want to address the concept of "Fear of the Unknown," the character of Simon, and the symbol of the beast in connection to one another. These factors combine to provide fundamental insights into the human mind, the conflict between civilization and barbarism, and the influence of terror on individuals and civilizations.

To begin, delving into the "Fear of the Unknown" subject allows us to dive into the basic concerns that drive human behavior. Fear drives the events on the island, influencing the protagonists' actions and decisions. It breeds anxiety and paranoia, eventually leading to the collapse of civilisation.

Following that, concentrating on Simon's character provides a distinct take on the issue. Simon's introverted personality, sensitivity, and connection to nature make him intensely aware of the darkness inside himself and others. He is an excellent symbol who depicts the effort to keep one's humanity in the midst of terror and confusion.

Finally, comprehending the underlying theme and character development is dependent on the symbol of the beast. The beast symbolizes an exterior threat at first, but it eventually becomes a representation of the boys' inner darkness and the disintegration of their civilisation. It represents their primitive inclinations, their decline into savagery as a result of fear, and the loss of their innocence.

We may follow the steady erosion of order and morality as terror takes root by evaluating the relationships between the topic, character, and symbol. We can explore the psychological impact of fear, the struggle to confront the unknown, and the consequences of succumbing to primal instincts. Finally, these components underscore the precarious balance between civilization and barbarism while also providing painful insights into the human condition.

Exploring Fear, Humanity, and Illusion in “The Lord of The Flies”, From Simon's perspective



William Golding's thought-provoking book Lord of the Flies tackles the darker aspects of human nature, including the effects of terror, the conflict between civilized society and primitive behavior, and the illusions that may distort reality. The story offers a thorough exploration of the divisive force of dread and the significance of preserving humanity in the midst of difficulty through the interaction between the topic of "Fear of the Unknown," the character of Simon, and the symbol of the beast.

The young men on the island descend into chaos and violence as a result of their fear of the unknown, which is a major subject throughout the book. Its growing anxiety causes society to fall apart and its moral principles to deteriorate. Their most fundamental fears and inclinations are stoked by the unknown, which the unexplored island symbolizes. As panic takes hold, the boys give up logic and turn to savagery, tragically losing their inherent decency.

Simon emerges as a light of humanity in the gloom. His persona exemplifies knowledge, empathy, and a fundamental comprehension of the human predicament. Simon's unselfish deeds, like locating fruit for the starving youngsters, show his unfailing compassion and willingness to aid others. He stands for the fight to preserve humanity and thwart the spread of barbarism. Simon's contacts with the beast symbol, especially his run-in with the "Lord of the Flies," demonstrate his profound understanding of the innate evil within each person. The book underlines the value of upholding our humanity and avoiding the evil's allure, even in the face of paralyzing dread, via his character.

The beast's emblem, which the boys at first took to be a physical danger, eventually came to represent their worries. As their anxiety about the unknown grows, they transfer their worries onto the beast and give it magical characteristics. The boys' warped vision of reality and propensity to lie to themselves are reflections of the power of fear to influence reality. Despite the beast's non-physical nature, they persuade themselves of its presence. This fear-induced illusion supports the novel's investigation of the psychological effects terror may have on people and their understanding of the outside world.

In conclusion, Lord of the Flies illustrates the destructive power of fear, the conflict between civilized society and primitive behavior, and the illusions that may skew our perceptions. The subject matter of "Fear of the Unknown," Simon the character, and the beast as a symbol all highlight the serious psychological and ethical repercussions of giving in to terror. We are pushed to consider our own capacity for good and evil, the brittleness of social systems, and the decisions we make in the midst of fear and uncertainty by comprehending how these factors interact. In the end, the book serves as a warning, imploring us to face our anxieties, keep our humanity, and halt the escalation of darkness and disorder.
